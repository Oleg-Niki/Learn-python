Completed Lab Report
Raw csv file from tensile test
Your excel sheet or .m file with data reduction complete
Overview:

In this lab, you will use standard test procedures to measure the mechanical properties of a metal specimen (specified when you receive the tensile test coupon).  During your assigned lab time, you will work in groups to carry out tensile, and Rockwell hardness tests.   

 

OBJECTIVES: After completing this lab, you should be able to:

Conduct a Tensile test is according to ASTM E8
Conduct a Rockwell Hardness test
Analyze the force and elongation data from a tensile test on a material in order to determine quantitative values of mechanical properties including Young’s Modulus, Yield Strength, (Ultimate) Tensile Strength, Ductility, Resilience, Toughness, and Strain Hardening Parameter K.
 

Procedures:

Refer to supplemental Hardness and Tensile Procedures on Canvas.

Each team member is responsible for filling out and completing the following data analysis sheet for your specimen.  If you have MATLAB skills you are highly encouraged to complete the data analysis in MATLAB

 

Lab Report:

Each person is to complete an individual lab report uploaded to Canvas as a .pdf which includes parts 1-6. Refer to the following documents on proper lab formatting as an example of what to expect for a lab report. http://www.csun.edu/~bavarian/Courses/MSE%20227/Labs/Memo_Report.pdfLinks to an external site.

Abstract
Procedure: A description of equipment and procedures of all tests carried out as well as any ASTM standards that followed or deviated from.
Results: Include all items requested in Rubric
A table showing your groups recorded geometry values for your specimen before and after testing
Plots engineering stress vs. engineering strain for the specimen tested by your group (1 zoomed into low strain region and 1 of of the entire tensile test) . the plots should include the following:
Yield Stress labeled showing .002 offset calculation (Include values on graph).

Ultimate Tensile Strength labeled (Include values on graph)

% Elongation labeled (Include values on graph).

A plot of true stress vs. true strain for the specimen tested by your group. Show your curve fit for determining the strain hardening parameters
a completed Specimen Properties Table (See Data Reduction Template)
Photos of the fracture surface of the specimen
Discussion: Your discussion should include the following as applicable (but is not limited to):
If your experimental method deviated from the stated lab procedure explain why.
A brief description of observations made during and after tensile test.  Were there any strange/abnormal loads observed?  What did the fracture surface look like, and does it look like a brittle or ductile fracture?  Do you think the specimen failed in Tension or Shear?
A comparison/correlation of the Hardness Test values with Tensile Test Values.
A comparison of the %elongation measured vs the %elongation predicted from the plot of engineering stress vs engineering strain.  If there is a discrepancy what might explain this?
Does your strain hardening parameter K value match with the crystal lattice of your specimen?
Discussion of errors in this experiment and their sources.
Appendix: Include equations used for calculations 
A list of references

Determination of Mechanical Properties From Force Displacement Curve Reference:

Take the linear region to be the maximum slope of the graph data from 0.05% to 0.5% strain
The Y.S. is taken as the intercept between the stress strain curve and the 0.2% offset curve.
