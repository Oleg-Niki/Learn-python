Objectives: 
Work collaboratively to create a module of related functions in Python. 

Look for your partners in Groups on Canvas
Your assignment:
This assignment is divided in two parts:

Part 1: (with a partner): share the workload with your partner to create the Antics.py module
Part 2 (individual): import the module you developed and test all function in a Jupyter Notebook
The Antics.py module
Create a module of functions to test alphabetical antics (or word play):

Palindrome: a word or sentence that reads the same backwards
Example: Anna, Bob, kayak, deed, rotator
Pangram: a phrase or sentence containing all 26 letters of the alphabet
Example: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Tautogram: a text in which all words start with the same letter
Example: Brilliant, because bacon bites beat bruschetta.
Isogram: a word in which no letter of the alphabet occurs more than once
Example: demographics
Abedecerian: a word in which the letters appear in alphabetical order
Example: bijoux, biopsy, dimpsy
Dobloon: a word in which every letter that appears in the word appears exactly twice
Example: murmur, noon, reappear, sees
Each function should receive a word as an argument and return true of false. Name the module antics.py

The Notebook
Make a copy of Lab 2 notebookLinks to an external site. on your Google Drive Colab Notebooks folder.
This part is individual
Also upload the Antics.py module to your Google Drive Colab Notebooks folder.
Follow the instructions to test your functions in Antics.py. 
 

Documentation 
In the Antics.py:

Write a header comment at the beginning of the antics.py module with the following information:
# CIS-117 Lab2
# Write a description of your module here
# Group#
# Names of all group members (first and last)
Document all functions in the module following docstring format
In the notebook:

Follow the instructions in the .ipynb for the header document there
 

Testing:
Follow the instructions in the notebook to import and test the module.

Submission:
The submission is individual. Turn in both:

Antics.py that you completed with your partner
Your notebook (Lab2_YourLastName_FirstName.ipynb) file
