Description: This module processes a CSV file containing country information, splits it by region,
and writes separate CSV files for each region. Each output file retains only the country name and region.
Author: [Your Name]
Group: [Your Group Number] â€“ Partners: [Partner Names, if applicable]
Collaboration: Describe briefly how the work was divided (e.g., one partner handled file reading, the other handled writing).
