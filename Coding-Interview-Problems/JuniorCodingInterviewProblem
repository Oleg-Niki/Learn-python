# Problem: Find the First Unique Character in a String

# Description:
# Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the index of the first non-repeating character. 
# If no unique character exists, return -1.

# Constraints:
# The input string will only contain lowercase English letters (a-z).
# The input string will have a length between 1 and 10^5.
# Function Signature (Python):

# python
# # Example 1:
# input = "leetcode"
# output = 0
# # Explanation: The first non-repeating character is 'l', at index 0.

# # Example 2:
# input = "loveleetcode"
# output = 2
# # Explanation: The first non-repeating character is 'v', at index 2.

# # Example 3:
# input = "aabbcc"
# output = -1
# # Explanation: There are no unique characters in the string.
# Hints:

# You can use a dictionary to count the frequency of each character.
# Once you have the frequency of characters, you can iterate through the string to find the first character with a frequency of 1.
